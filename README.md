# Climate Analysis Toolkit

this is a set of python scripts designed to analyze datafiles.

If you're interested in collaborating, email me at alschub@umich.edu

To install a copy of the toolkit, open a terminal and run:

git clone git@github.com:alschub.climate-analysis.git

**This code is currently in development and not all features will work.**
